# Unit Converter

Part of the "Making Websites Interactive" Module of Scrimba's frotend developer career path, the Unit Converter was a neat little project I put together. Granted, the good gave us a final design to work towards but all the code was put together by me (and frankly I couldn't have done it without Per's lessons!)

In terms of improvements that could be made, I definitely took a brute force approach to the conversions in the js file and I would like to go back and refactor to be a bit more DRY friendly once I have a spare moment. 

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
