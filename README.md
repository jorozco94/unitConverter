# Unit Converter

A simple unit converting application that allows users to go from metric to imperial and vice versa.

## How It Works

1. Users can input a numerical value into the input field

2. Press the "Convert" button

3. See the resulting conversions under 3 categories (Length, Volume, and Mass) in the bottom half of the application.

NOTE: The units of the input don't matter (as long as it's a valid number) because the conversion takes care of converting from metric to imperial and imperial to metric for each category. If a non numerical value is input into the textbox, an alert message will display asking the user to input a number.
